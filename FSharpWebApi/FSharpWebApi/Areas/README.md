#API Help Generator

This is a port of the HelpPage area that ships with the ASP.NET Web Api template. 

NOTE:

F# project management is a bit stupid in that you cannot have folders with the
same name no matter if they are in subfolders:

for instance

The Web API project has a folder called Models and so does the HelpPage Area but
that cannot work in F# so I've taken the liberty to prefix the Models folder in 
the HelpPage Area with HP. I'll do this for all the folders in this area so that
it doesn't prevent Visual Studio from opening the project.

##Status

Not yet usable. The port has just begun.
