A port of the C# ASP.NET Web API project template to F#

##Status

This is a bit confusing at the moment. Here is my thought process. I ported the
C# ASP.NET MVC 5 template to F# and now I'm taking that and porting it to 
ASP.NET Web API. I figured I'd have some of the infrastructure there and only
need to port a little more. I'm not quite there yet, give it a few more days,
hopefully just one more day and I'll have it complete. LOL!
